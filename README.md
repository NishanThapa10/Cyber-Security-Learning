# Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity

## 1. World of Cybersecurity
- Cybersecurity is the practice of defending systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.
- It involves protecting information confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA Triad).
- The increasing reliance on digital technology has made cybersecurity crucial for both individuals and organizations.

## 2. Organizational Data
- Organizational data is the digital information stored, processed, and transmitted by an organization.
- Protecting this data is essential to prevent breaches that could lead to data theft, financial loss, and reputation damage.

## 3. Cyber Attackers
- Cyber attackers can be individuals, groups, or organizations that intentionally target systems or networks for malicious purposes.
- Types of cyber attackers:
  - **Hacktivists**: Attack for political or social causes.
  - **Cybercriminals**: Attack for financial gain.
  - **Nation-state actors**: Governments conducting cyber espionage or warfare.

## 4. Cyber Warfare
- Cyber warfare refers to the use of digital attacks by one nation to disrupt or damage the information systems of another nation.
- It can target critical infrastructure like power grids, financial institutions, and government services.


# Module 2 - Attack , Concepts and Techniques

## 1 Analyzing a cyber attack 
- Types of malware - Spyware, Adware, Backdoor, Ransomware, Scareware, Rootkit, Virus, Trojan horse, Worms
- Symptoms of malware - Increase in CPU usage, freezing or crashing, decrease in  web browsing speed, modified or deleted files, unknown files, emails sent without consent or knowledge , programs auto running.

## 2 Methods of Infiltration 

- Social Engineering - Social engineering is the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful, but they also prey on their weaknesses. For example, an attacker will call an authorized employee with an urgent problem that requires immediate network access and appeal to the employee’s vanity or greed or invoke authority by using name-dropping techniques in order to gain this access.

- Denial-of-Service(DoS)-  A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service to users, devices or applications. 

- Distributed DoS - A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a cyberattack that floods a target with malicious traffic from multiple sources, aiming to disrupt its normal operations and make it inaccessible to legitimate users. These attacks utilize a network of compromised devices, often called a botnet, to generate the overwhelming traffic. 

- Botnet - A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email attachment or infected media file. A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that can be controlled by a malicious individual or group. It can have tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of bots that are typically controlled through a command and control server. These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks. Cybercriminals will often rent out botnets to third parties for nefarious purposes.

- On-path Attacks(man in the middle attack) - On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web browser and a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices.

- SEO Poisoning 

- Wifi Password Cracking 

-Password Attacks - Password Spraying, Dictionary attacks, Brute-force attack, Rainbow attacks, Traffic Interception .

## 3 Security Vulnerability and Exploits 

- Hardware Vulnerability 
- Software Vulnerability - Buffer Overflow, Non-valiated input, Race conditions, Weaknesses in security practices, Access control
- Software Update   

## 4 The cybersecurity landscape 
-  Cryptocurrency
-  Cryptojacking 


# Module 3 - Protecting your data and privacy

## 1. Protecting your computer devices

- Turn the firewall on
- Install antivirus
- Manage your operating browser
- Setup password protection 

## 2. Wireless Network Security at home
## 3. Public Wi-Fi Risks
## 4. Password Security 
## 5. Using a passpharse 

## 3.2 Data Maintenance

- Encription - Encryption is the process of converting information into a form in which unauthorized parties cannot read it. Only a trusted, authorized person with the secret key or password can decrypt the data and access it in its original form. Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) to protect its confidentiality and integrity.
- Back up data  

## 3.3 Who owns your data? 
- Terms of Services - Understand the terms (Data use policy, Privacy Settings, Security Policy)

## 3.4 Safeguarding your online privacy
 - Two factor authentication, Open authorization

# Module 4 Protecting the Organization

## 4.1 CyberSecurity Devices and Appliances

- Routers, Firewall, IPS, VPN, Antivirus, Other Security Devices

## Types of Firewalls
- Network layer Firewall, Transport Layer Firewall, Application layer firewall, Context aware layer firewall, Proxy server, NAT, Host-based firewall 

# Penetration Testing 
- Penetration testing, commonly known as pen testing, is the act of assessing a computer system, network or organization for security vulnerabilities. A pen test seeks to breach systems, people, processes and code to uncover vulnerabilities which could be exploited. This information is then used to improve the system’s defenses to ensure that it is better able to withstand cyber attacks in the future.

# Risk Management 
- Cybersecurity risk management is a structured process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential threats to digital assets and systems. It involves implementing strategies and measures to protect against cyberattacks and minimize the impact of potential breaches.
